This documentation website can be updated by updating the .md files in the `docs/` folder.

Module documentations should be added to the `docs/modules/` folder not in the module directory.

## Adding/Updating Documentations:
- It's easy!!
    - Simply edit your file.
    - Add to the right folder in the `docs/` folder
    - If path information doesn't exists in `mkdocs.yml`, add it.
    - Create a PR against the development branch.
- Once your change is merged, the changes will automatically reflect on our [website](https://deliveryhero.github.io/pd-mob-b2c-android/).
- Wait time is typically between 5 to 15 mins.
- You should reward yourself with a cup of coffee, you just saved another engineer some time.
- You're the best, yes you!

## PS
